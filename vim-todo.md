### Spelling

Use [s and ]s to jump to misspellings. `z=` to show a list of candidate
replacements. `zg` adds the word as good. `zw` adds bad word.

### New tricks

`das` delete a sentence up until the beginning of the next sentence. `dis`
deletes up to the end of the deleted sentence. 

"d" = delete "i" or "a" = in or around "s" = derp

15 years later I learn this. `dip` and `dap` for paragraphs. 

### Argument List

Versus buffer list. Never heard of this. Looks interesting.

### Changes to Make

Get fzf set up correctly. 

You probably don't need ctags. 

Look into filemarks.

### Markdown Preview

This isn't working yet. I can make it work with a manual command, but the
keybinding isn't doing the job.

`!open Marked\ 2.app %`

that works.  The keybinding in the ftplugin doesn't. Also, I'm kinda drunk.

### Journaling

Having a general-purpose journal a la Day One in one section. The five minute
journal in another.

Prompts for the latter:

*AM*
1. I am grateful for... 3 things
2. What would make today great? 3 things
3. Daily Affirmations; I am... 2 things

*PM*
1. 3 Amazig things that happened today
2. How could today have been better? 2 things
