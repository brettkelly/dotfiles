### Spelling

Use [s and ]s to jump to misspellings. `z=` to show a list of candidate
replacements. `zg` adds the word as good. `zw` adds bad word.

### New tricks

`das` delete a sentence up until the beginning of the next sentence. `dis`
deletes up to the end of the deleted sentence. 

"d" = delete "i" or "a" = in or around "s" = derp

15 years later I learn this. `dip` and `dap` for paragraphs. 

### Argument List

Versus buffer list. Never heard of this.

### VimWiki ideas

VimWiki seems slick and useful for storing code snippets and other stuff.
Easier than making gists and more lightweight. Plus, you know, private. I can
see this turning into a fatass rabbit hole if I'm not careful.

* Snippets of shell stuff
* Diary/Journal (!!)
* Day Logs
* One Line Journal; do funky grep to compare previous years
* Commonplace book? probably not
* Book log
* Recipes?

*Can vimwiki do categories or taxonomies?*

### Changes to Make

You have a ton of cruft in vimrc. A bunch of functions you can't read and whose
utility is, at this point, dubious. Figure out which ones are actually in use.
Add comments and remove the trash.

Add comments. Break the thing into sections. Add filetype stuff into ftplugin
files to clean up the base config.

Get fzf set up correctly. 

You probably don't need ctags. 


Look into filemarks.
