### Stuff to eventually do

* Sort out a workflow for composing prose in markdown/vim and dumping to external file sources (like G Drive) where I can continue editing. The bulk of the work will be in markdown, though. The move/translation process should be as painless as possible.

* Create a (hidden?) git repo where I can store documents and odds and ends

* Finish config'ing zsh so the prompt is pretty.
* Get fzf set up for zsh

The goal is to make working with two Macs as pleasant and friction-free as possible. Using git and cloud services to manage data will make this so.
