### Stuff to eventually do

* Sort out a workflow for composing prose in markdown/vim and dumping to
  external file sources (like G Drive) where I can continue editing. The bulk of
  the work will be in markdown, though. The move/translation process should be
  as painless as possible.

* Create a (hidden?) git repo where I can store documents and odds and ends;
  This is a job for vimwiki, I think.

* Finish config'ing zsh so the prompt is pretty.
* Get fzf set up for zsh

The goal is to make working with two Macs as pleasant and friction-free as
possible. Using git and cloud services to manage data will make this so.

### TaskPaper

Ok, hear me out.

This *could* replace Trello. Maybe. Simple, task-specific text files. 

Store everything in a private github repo. 

Think it over.
